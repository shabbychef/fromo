\title{Join or unjoin moments computations.}
\usage{
join_moments(ret1, ret2)

unjoin_moments(ret3, ret2)
}
\arguments{
\item{ret1}{an \eqn{ord+1} vector as output by \code{\link{raw_sums}}? consisting of
the count, the mean, then the k through ordth centered sum of some observations.}

\item{ret2}{an \eqn{ord+1} vector as output by \code{\link{raw_sums}}? consisting of
the count, the mean, then the k through ordth centered sum of some observations.}

\item{ret3}{an \eqn{ord+1} vector as output by \code{\link{raw_sums}}? consisting of
the count, the mean, then the k through ordth centered sum of some observations.}
}
\value{
a vector the same size as the input consisting of the adjusted version of the input.
When there are not sufficient (non-nan) elements for the computation, \code{NaN} are returned.
}
\details{
merge or unmerge sums of centered variables.
}
\note{
The moment computations provided by fromo are 
numerically robust, but will often \emph{not} provide the
same results as the 'standard' implementations,
due to differences in roundoff. We make every attempt to balance
speed and robustness. User assumes all risk from using
the fromo package.

 set.seed(1234)
 x1 <- rnorm(1e3,mean=1)
 x2 <- rnorm(1e3,mean=1)

 rs1alt <- unjoin_moments(rs3,rs2)
 rs2alt <- unjoin_moments(rs3,rs1)
