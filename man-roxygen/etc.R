#' The moment computations provided by fromo are 
#' numerically robust, but will often \emph{not} provide the
#' same results as the 'standard' implementations,
#' due to differences in roundoff. We make every attempt to balance
#' speed and robustness. User assumes all risk from using
#' the fromo package.
